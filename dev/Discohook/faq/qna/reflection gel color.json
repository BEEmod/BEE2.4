Reflection Gel is hardcoded to use the color of Conversion Gel (`portal_paint_color`) when on a surface, and the color of Propulsion Gel (`speed_paint_color`) on light bridges and when splashed on the screen. We can separately change the color of the blobs though, which has been done, making them a dark gray.",
