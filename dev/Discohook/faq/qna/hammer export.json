                "description": "`puzzlemaker_export` does not work with BEEmod, as the custom compiler isn't able to modify the map and make it actually functional. Before reading on however, keep in mind that exporting Puzzlemaker maps to Hammer is usually not the best idea. If you want to make extensive modifications to a map, or are just starting out learning Hammer, it's generally easier to build a map from scratch rather than trying to modify a Puzzlemaker map. Only consider exporting if you just want to make small adjustments to a map, and already have experience using Hammer.\n\nIf this is what you want to do, first set Spawn Point to Elevator and disable Restart When Reaching Exit in the BEE2 app. Compile your map in Puzzlemaker, then open `maps/styled/preview.vmf` in Hammer and resave it to a different location so it doesn't get overwritten. Additionally, check your Build Programs settings to make sure that you're using the BEE2 version of VRAD (simply called `vrad.exe`), as this is needed for some features such as music to work.",
