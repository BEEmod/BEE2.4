                "description": "Styles take a lot of work to create and maintain, so new ones are rarely added. For a new style to even be considered, it should make sense overall, work with most/all of Portal 2's test elements, and be possible to reasonably implement in the Puzzlemaker.\n\nAs an example, Portal 1 is a style that fits this criteria, as most of Portal 2's test elements can reasonably exist there and it has a block-based structure similar to Clean. On the other hand, BTS style typically doesn't use test elements like buttons and cubes, and it's very difficult to make it look good in the Puzzlemaker. The only reason BTS was added is because these guidelines didn't exist yet at the time.\n\nIf your suggested style is a simple variant of an existing style (e.g. Original Clean, which just changes wall textures), it may be added. Custom packages can also add their own styles, so feel free to implement a new style yourself.",
