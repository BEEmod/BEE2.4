                "description": "The Source engine has very strict limits on toggleable lights. Only two dynamic lights can affect a single surface, and only 32 possible combinations of light states can exist across the entire map. This makes toggleable lights infeasible for a mod such as BEE2, as the majority of users are not going to be aware of these restrictions. Additionally, darkness is not meant to be used as a test element. It doesn't actually affect the puzzle in any way and is just annoying. So while this is technically possible to an extent, it's not going to be implemented either way.",
