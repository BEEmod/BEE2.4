Antivirus software will often assume that if a file isn't commonly downloaded, it must be malware. *Real* viruses are also sometimes written in Python, meaning they would share many of the same libraries and files. Additionally, BEE2.4 does several things which could cause it to be seen as a virus - copying a bunch of files into the folder for another program (Portal 2), and replacing executables with its own versions (the compilers). However, we can assure you that BEE2.4 does not contain any malicious code. If you don't believe us, [check for yourself](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4/tree/master/src); the entire project is open-source.",

However, this is **not** the correct way of uninstalling - although the editor items and style will be restored to default, editor textures will not be reverted and many custom assets added by BEE2.4 will be left in the game files. To fully uninstall BEE2.4, select the game you want to uninstall it from and choose *File > Uninstall from Selected Game*. This will completely remove BEE2.4 from the game, including editor textures and custom assets.\n\nTo uninstall the BEE2 app itself, perform the above steps, then simply delete the application folder.",

On the other hand, BTS style typically doesn't use test elements like buttons and cubes, and it's very difficult to make it look good in the Puzzlemaker. The only reason BTS was added is because these guidelines didn't exist yet at the time.\n\nIf your suggested style is a simple variant of an existing style (e.g. Original Clean, which just changes wall textures), it may be added. Custom packages can also add their own styles, so feel free to implement a new style yourself.",

It is possible to re-create Adhesion Gel using tricks with rotating the map, but this can't reasonably work in the Puzzlemaker.\n\nMore recently, mods such as Desolation and Portal 2: Community Edition have obtained the source code from Valve and reimplemented Adhesion Gel properly.

In this case it's fine if they can't be distinguished, since the player can just keep track of that themselves (as if the cubes were uncolored). Most good puzzles don't need more than 2 cubes, so just the default cube and sphere types usually work fine. Additional unique cube types (such as a triangle cube) have also been discussed.",

Only two dynamic lights can affect a single surface, and only 32 possible combinations of light states can exist across the entire map. This makes toggleable lights infeasible for a mod such as BEE2, as the majority of users are not going to be aware of these restrictions. Additionally, darkness is not meant to be used as a test element. It doesn't actually affect the puzzle in any way and is just annoying.

It also relies on many custom assets which would need to be packed into maps, exceeding the Workshop file size limit very easily. Even if ways around both of these things were found, the style also makes use of custom features of Desolation's engine, which can't be replicated in standard Portal 2.\n\nImplementing the style within Desolation itself would solve the latter two issues, but Desolation won't be able to use Valve's puzzlemaker for technical reasons, and the developers currently have no plans to write their own. It also wouldn't solve the first problem, which is actually generating Industrial maps.\n\nAdditionally, see the question above about new styles in general.",

                "description": "`puzzlemaker_export` does not work with BEEmod, as the custom compiler isn't able to modify the map and make it actually functional. Before reading on however, keep in mind that exporting Puzzlemaker maps to Hammer is usually not the best idea. If you want to make extensive modifications to a map, or are just starting out learning Hammer, it's generally easier to build a map from scratch rather than trying to modify a Puzzlemaker map. Only consider exporting if you just want to make small adjustments to a map, and already have experience using Hammer.\n\nIf this is what you want to do, first set Spawn Point to Elevator and disable Restart When Reaching Exit in the BEE2 app. Compile your map in Puzzlemaker, then open `maps/styled/preview.vmf` in Hammer and resave it to a different location so it doesn't get overwritten. Additionally, check your Build Programs settings to make sure that you're using the BEE2 version of VRAD (simply called `vrad.exe`), as this is needed for some features such as music to work.",
