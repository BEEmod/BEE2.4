        Compiler bugs are errors or unexpected behaviors in the BEEmod compiler, **NOT** compiler crashes!
        Compiler crashes should be reported in the [BEE2-items repo](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/).

        If this is your first time opening an issue here, please read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/BEEmod/.github/blob/c865feea6f7f4bd9a65e8aaecac9c7731db9628f/contributing.md).

        Remember:
        - Do not open an issue if you are not using the latest BEEmod application and packages.
        - Make sure you're in the right place. Item and style related issues should go in the [BEE2-items repo](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/).
        - Perform a search to make sure this issue hasn't already been reported.
        - Do not use the issue tracker to ask questions.
        - Issues should not be combined, unless they are very closely related (e.g. two bugs with a specific item in a specific case).
        - Make absolutely sure the issue is not UCP (User Created Packages) related
